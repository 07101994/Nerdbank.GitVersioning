The dotnet CLI works very much like [full MSBuild](msbuild.md). Just use `dotnet build` instead of `msbuild.exe`.

Check out our [nbgv .NET Core CLI tool](nbgv-cli.md) to install Nerdbank.GitVersioning and maintain your repos/projects more easily.

[DNX never supported extensible versioning systems](https://github.com/aspnet/dnx/issues/3178). But DNX is dead now, so you probably don't care.
