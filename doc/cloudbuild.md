# Cloud build support

Nerdbank.GitVersioning implicitly supports all cloud build services and CI
server software because it simply uses git itself and integrates naturally
in MSBuild, gulp and other build scripts.

## Requirements

1. Your CI build should be configured to actually clone the git repo rather than
   download sources (i.e. the '.git' folder is required).
1. Do not enable any 'shallow clone' option on your CI build, as that erases
   git history that is required for accurate version calculation.

## Optional features

By specifying certain `cloudBuild` options in your `version.json` file,
you can activate features for some cloud build systems, as follows

### Automatically match cloud build numbers to to your git version

Cloud builds tend to associate some calendar date or monotonically increasing
build number to each build. These build numbers are not very informative, if at all.
Instead, Nerdbank.GitVersioning can automatically set your cloud build's
build number to equal the semver version calculated during your build.

Enable this feature by setting the `cloudBuild.buildNumber.enabled` field
in your `version.json` file to `true`, as shown below:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "cloudBuild": {
    "buildNumber": {
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

When any cloud build starts, a build number is initially generated by the CI server until
the build itself overrides it as this option will cause it to do. If a build aborts before
the build reassigns the build number, it will remain at the cloud assigned build number.
This can show up in your build history with some failed builds having a different versioning
scheme than passing or some other failed builds.

When you enable this feature, consider whether this will cause the generated build numbers
to overlap with those generated by the cloud build previously or in the future.
For example, AppVeyor defaults to assigning build numbers with a 1.0.x notation where x
increases. If your version.json file sets your version to "1.0", the generated build numbers
can overlap, making AppVeyor fail builds due to a non-unique number. To avoid this,
make sure that your CI build creates initial build numbers that do not overlap with those
produced by semantic versioning. For instance, you can set your appveyor build's version
to 1.1000 or 50.0 so that your regular semantic version build numbers are in an entirely unique
range.

### Set special build variables for use in subsequent build steps

| Build variable | MSBuild property | Sample value
| --- | --- | --- |
| GitAssemblyInformationalVersion | AssemblyInformationalVersion | 1.3.1+g15e1898f47
| GitBuildVersion | BuildVersion | 1.3.1.57621

This means you can use these variables in subsequent steps in your cloud build
such as publishing artifacts, so that your richer version information can be
expressed in the publish location or artifact name.

Enable this feature by setting the `cloudBuild.setVersionVariables` field
in your `version.json` file to `true`, as shown below:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "cloudBuild": {
    "setVersionVariables": true
  }
}
```

## CI Server specific configurations

### TeamCity
TeamCity does not expose the build branch by default as an environment variable. This can be exposed by
adding an environment variable with the value of `%teamcity.build.vcs.branch.<vcsid>%` where `<vcsid>` is
the root id described on the TeamCity VCS roots page. Details on this variable can be found on the
[TeamCity docs](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD8/Predefined+Build+Parameters).
